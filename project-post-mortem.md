Approach and Process
What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?

-I would perhaps have planned some contingency plans for when i get stuck with errors.

What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?

-Sticking with delivering the mvp to ensure that everything is in working order prior to adding furthers.

Code and Code Design
What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

-I would probably develop functions to add in my additional features instead of trying to hardcode them in.

What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?

-creating sub functions to carry out tasks. 

/*var nextQnButton = function (event) {
    var nextQnButton = document.createElement("button");
    nextQnButton.id = "next-qn";
    nextQnButton.textContent = "Next Question";
    nextQnButton.type = "button";
    nextQnButton.onclick = function () { nextQn() };
    optionsDisplay.appendChild(nextQnButton);
};

var nextQn = function (event) {
    document.getElementById("next-qn").outerHTML = "";
    addOptions();
    displayQn(count);
};*/

For each, please include code examples.

What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?

-Console.log was very helpful. it is able to tell me where my errors are.

What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?

-My code planning and timekeeping for preparation of the code

How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
